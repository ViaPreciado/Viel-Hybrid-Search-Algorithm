# Viel-Hybrid-Search-Algorithm
Binary Search and Linear Search are the two most commonly used searching algorithms to find items in an array. This study reveals the Viel Search Algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that leverages Binary Search's efficiency with the capability of Linear Search to improve search operations in both sorted and unsorted arrays.
