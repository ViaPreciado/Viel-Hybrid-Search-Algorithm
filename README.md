# Viel-Hybrid-Search-Algorithm
ABSTRACT
Binary Search and Linear Search are the two most commonly used searching algorithms to find items in an array. This study reveals the Viel Search Algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that leverages Binary Search's efficiency with the capability of Linear Search to improve search operations in both sorted and unsorted arrays. Unlike typical search methods, this hybrid algorithm continuously selects between Binary and Linear Search based on the input data's value.

The performance evaluations of the Viel Search Algorithm were conducted on arrays with sizes ranging from 10 to 500,000 integers, containing both sorted and unsorted elements. The results consistently showed that the Viel Search Algorithm outperforms traditional Binary and Linear methods, especially when dealing with large and unsorted arrays. These findings suggest that the Viel Search Algorithm offers significant improvements in search efficiency, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of computational applications.
